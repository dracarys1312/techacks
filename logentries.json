He joined the Forest Hills Ambulance Corps at the age of 14 as a Junior Corps member and excelled in the position of Dispatcher and at 18 joined the Senior Corps. Richie headed to the WTC on foot from his job at a law firm and was ordered back to his job by his employer for safety reasons, but remained at the WTC site. A picture on pages 16-17 in Newsweek's Extra Edition of America Under Attack shows Richie aiding the injured. He was only 18 years old. We have named the ride in his honor, \"Run For Richie\". ",
